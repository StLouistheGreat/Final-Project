# Final-Project

Here is the thing. I have had to buy two different laptops during the course of this bootcamp. So I thought to myself.
In this presentation the objective is to make data driven decision making in acquiring a new laptop.
The goal is to analyze and correlate the price of laptops based on various features such as company, type, size, screen resolution, CPU, RAM, 
storage, GPU, operating system, and weight. This can help in understanding the key factors that influence laptop pricing and assist in making informed decisions for both me a  consumer, but also businesses.

# Insights
Asus Gaming Laptops: Asus gaming laptops are prominently featured, suggesting they offer significant value for money, with prices significantly lower than predicted.
Dell and Lenovo Gaming Laptops: These brands also provide good value, particularly for gaming models, which are underpriced relative to their features.
2 in 1 Convertible: Lenovo's 2 in 1 convertible is also an excellent value option, providing flexibility and performance at a lower price than predicted.

# Recommendations
Best Brands: Asus, Dell, and Lenovo are top brands offering value for money in gaming and notebook categories.
Optimal Purchase: Customers seeking the best specs for their spend should consider gaming laptops from Asus and Dell, as well as convertible models from Lenovo.
This analysis provides a comprehensive view of the best value laptops. If further machine learning analysis is needed, we could consider clustering or advanced predictive modeling, but the current approach offers clear and actionable insights. â€‹
